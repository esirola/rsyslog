READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY OR YOU'll END UP IN LICENSING HELL!

Note: this is a special version that was ported by IBM. IBM released
the patches under GPLv3+, so all code -even ones that claim differently-
is under GPLv3+ (as long as it contains code from the IBM commit).

Newer rsyslog versions contain files that are under ASL 2.0. It is
a long-term goal of the project to change the license (at least for
almost all files). If you now merge IBM's contribution back into
those higher versions, files again get infected by GPLv3, and as
IBM has not agreed to license the patch set under ASL 2.0, we would
never have a chance to reach our licensing goal. As such, it is
FORBIDDEN to use any code found in this branch and merge,
copy and paste, remember and rewrite, ... (whatever) inside newer
rsyslog versions. For the same reason, the rsyslog team has never
looked at this code (except for the quick merge) and will not do
so. This helps all users by preventing accidential infection.

Please use this code at your own risk. The rsyslog project does NOT
support this version.

Beside these restrictions, we thank the IBM team for making a version
of rsyslog available on AIX.
